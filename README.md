### The Fishing Network Mobile
This react native mobile app can build easily on both iOS and Android. The app allows users to easily upload data to the Fishing Network's web database. The user can then visualize all the data they added on the <a rel="license" href="https://github.com/msalicefredine/the-fishing-network">Fishing Network's web platform</a>.

### Next Steps
The Fishing Network mobile wants to support all the data that is offered on the web. Also, to reduce confusion, we want to customize some input fields to better suit the input data like having a date picker for date inputs. The Fishing Network also is looking to allow users to quickly query data on the mobile app and visualize the data on the go.
