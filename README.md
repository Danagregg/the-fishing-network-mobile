### Future Improvements
Since this was created at Fishackathon Vancouver 2016, we had a limited amount of time to complete the project. A lot of things had to get cut. We wanted to add more data fields for the user and even allow the user to add more text fields for certain data fields so that it is more user friendly to list species in a catch for example rather than inputting all that data into one text box.
